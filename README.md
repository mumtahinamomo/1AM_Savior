# 1AM_Savior (Statistics Calculator)
# Why suffer when you can automate?
I'm taking a statistics class this semester, and my professor gave me a whole bunch of homework. I didn't want to calculate the statistical values of big datasets using a calculator at 1 AM (it takes ages!). So, I made a computer program using Python to do the calculations for me. Now, my code does most of my homework and helps me finish my homework faster
